# Infection! Germs vs White Cells - Game Design Document

## Overview
Infection is a two-plyer game (one human, one computer) played on grids of varying
sizes and designs. Players take turns adding one dot to an available cell in the grid.
Play continues until one player owns all the cells on the board.

An available cell is one that does not already contain a dot or one that is
alrady owned by the player. Let's say that player one is red and player two is
blue.

- If player one adds a dot to an empty cell, that cell becomes red.
- A cell has a "capacity" equal to the number of orthogonally adjacent cells.
  - A cell in the middle of the board has a capacity of 4.
  - A cell on an edge (but not a corner) has a capacity of 3.
  - A cell in a corner has a capacity of 2.
- If a player adds a dot to a cell they already own, the number of dots in that
  cell increases by one.
- If the number of dots in a cell exceeds its capacity, that cell "explodes".
  - The cell loses a number of dots equal to its capacity.
  - Each orthogonally adjacent cell gains one dot from the exploding cell.
  - If an adjacent cell is owned by the opposing player, it becomes owned by
    the player who caused the explosion.
  - If an adjacent cell now exceeds its capacity, it also explodes. This can
    cause a chain reaction of explosions.
- The game ends when one player owns all the cells on the board.


## Board design
The default board is a 5x5 grid:


```text

|       |       |       |       |       |
|       |       |       |       |       |

|       |       |       |       |       |

```


The board size is configuralbe (up to 9x9) and the design can be changed to
create different gameplay experiences. For example, the following board has
some cells that act as solid blocks. These cells cannot be played in or
owned by either player.

|XXXXXXX|       |       |       |XXXXXXX|
|XXXXXXX|       |       |       |XXXXXXX|

## User interface

This game is a Phaser 3 project that uses the Vue framework, TypeScript and
Vite for bundling. It includes a bridge for Vue to Phaser game communication,
hot-reloading for quick development workflow and scripts to generate
production-ready builds.

The game is played in a browser. The user interface includes:

- A main menu with options:
    - About
    - Tutorial
    - Splash
    - Settings
    - Start Game
    - High Scores (future)
- A game board that displays the grid, dots, and player turns.
- A sidebar or overlay that shows the current player's turn, scores, and game status.
- A settings menu to adjust game options such as board size and design.
- Level over and game over scenes that announce the winner and offers options.
- Sound effects and possibly background music to enhance the gaming experience.
- Responsive design to ensure the game is playable on various screen sizes and devices.
- Accessibility features such as keyboard controls and screen reader support.
- See more in the "Game plan" section below.


## Difficulty levels

### Definitions
Fully loaded cell (or full cell): A cell that has a number of dots equal to its
    capacity and will explode if another dot is added.

Low capacity cell: A cell with a low capacity, such as a corner cell (capacity
    of 2) or an edge cell (capacity of 3).

Cell ullage: The difference between a cell's capacity and the number of dots it
    currently contains. For example, a corner cell with 1 dot has an ullage of 1
    (capacity 2 - 1 dot = 1 ullage).

Advantage cell: A cell that has ullage equal to or less than all adjacent
    opponent cells. For example, if a player has a corner cell with 1 dot (ullage
    1) next to an opponent's edge cell with 2 dots (ullage 1) and an empty cell
    (ullage 3), the corner cell is an advantage cell because its ullage (1) is
    equal to or less than the adjacent opponent cells' ullages (1 and 3).


### Strategy levels
The computer opponent can be set to different difficulty levels:

- Easy: The computer make a random valid move. (This is the default level.)
- Medium: The computer searches for a cell in the following order:
    - a fully loaded cell
    - a low capacity free cell (like a corner cell)
    - a random valid move
- Hard: The computer searches for a cell in the following order:
    - a full cell next to an opponent's full cell
    - a fully loaded cell next to an opponent's cell
    - any fully loaded cell
    - a low capacity free cell (like a corner cell)
    - a random valid move
- Expert: The computer searches for a cell in the following order:
    - a full cell next to an opponent's full cell
    - a fully loaded cell next to an opponent's cell
    - any fully loaded cell
    - an advantage cell
    - a low capacity free cell (like a corner cell)
    - a random valid move

## Game levels and level sets
- Each game will be comprised of multiple levels, called a level set.
- Each level will have a different board design and/or size.
- Each level will have a name and a brief description.
- Each level set will have a name and a brief description.
- Levels and level sets will be defined in JSON files to facilitate easy creation and modification.
- Players can unlock new levels by completing, though not necessarily winning, previous ones.
- A player's progress will be saved, allowing them to resume from the last completed level and board state.
- We will now have the idea winning/losing a level and winning/losing a game.
- A player's final score for the game will be based on their performance across all levels in the level set.
- In the settings menu players can choose a different level set (from a list) to play for the next game.
